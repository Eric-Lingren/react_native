                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    To be included in a hand, a Player must lay out an initial bet.
                    The Dealer will deal two cards to each player who has placed a bet face up (unless it is a pitch game).  Dont touch the cards!
                    The Dealer takes two cards as well. One of the Dealer‚Äôs cards is placed face up. The Dealer‚Äôs facedown card is called a "hole card."
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    Once all initial cards are dealt, if the Dealer has an Ace showing a side bet called ‚ÄúInsurance‚Äù is offered to Players. If the Dealer‚Äôs hole card is any 10-point card, insurance will pay 2-to-1. (note: Insurance wagers may not exceed half the original wager).
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    The Dealer will check his hole card at this time. If the Dealer has a blackjack, all wagers lose, except those who took the insurance bet or those players who also have a blackjack, resulting in a push.
                    If the Dealer does not have a blackjack, play continues normally.
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    The Player to the left of the Dealer starts.
                    The following options are available to each Player:
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Stand - Player indicates they want no more cards
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Hit - Player asks for additional card(s)
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Double - Player doubles her bet. Doubling is like Hitting, but only one additional card is provided to the Player.
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Split - When a Player has a pair or any two 10-point cards, splitting is a method of separating each card into two separate hands, thereby doubling the bet (each of the two new hands is worth the original bet). 
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    The Dealer will deal a new card to each of the split cards. The Player then plays each hand out normally. A few rules apply:
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Splitting is only allowed on the first move of each hand.
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  When splitting Aces, only one additional card can be dealt to each (some casino rules do not allow splitting Aces).
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Obtaining a ten and an ace after splitting counts as 21 points, not blackjack.
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Splitting is generally limited to a total of four hands.
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Doubling may or may not be allowed after splitting.
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    ‚óÜ  Surrender - this option is only available with the initial two cards dealt. In this case a Player surrenders half their wager and does not play out their hand (Note: some rules do not allow Surrenders).
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    When all Players are satisfied with their hands & want no more cards or have busted, the Dealer will play out his hand.
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    The Dealer flips over his hole card.
                    If the Dealer has 16 points or less, they will draw one or more cards.
                    Soft 17 occurs when the Dealer has an Ace and any number of additional cards totalling six points. House rules determine if the Dealer hits on soft 17.
