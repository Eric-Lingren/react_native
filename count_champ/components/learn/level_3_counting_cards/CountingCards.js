                    The purpose of a running count is to keep track of the historical cards that have already been dealt.

                    Card counting is not a mysterious or magical skill.  Counting cards is simply keeping track of what cards have already been played in order to better predict the cards that will be played in the future.

                    You will always utilize Basic Strategy to make your playing decisions;  Counting cards enhances your ability to make strategic moves by keeping track of what cards are left in the deck.

                    Learning basic strategy is actually much more complex than learning to count cards so if you have already done that, the hard part is out of the way!

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    The basic principle regarding counting cards is that a deck with more 10-point cards and aces is beneficial for the Player because they will receive more blackjacks, while a deck stacked with small cards is to the Dealerâ€™s advantage because they have less of a chance to bust.

                    Cards are assigned values:

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    2-6 are assigned a value of +1.

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    7-9 are assigned a value of 0 and we ignore them.

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    10-point cards and Aces are assigned a value of -1.

                    When more high cards are played we know that there will be more low cards in the future and vice versa. We keep track of this with the running count.

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    Every time a card is played, you add its value to maintain what is called a running count. You always want to start counting at the beginning of a shoe, starting with 0.

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
                    The 8 is worth 0, so the count stays at Plus 1.

                    The 5 is worth 1, so the count goes to Plus 2.
